-Improve vehicle collision response with spheres
-Driving onto a slope from the side is jittery 

-Zoom camera in when obscured by an obstacle

-Fake Item Boxes should rebound off slopes
	
-Possible particle effects to add/improve:
	-Add exhaust particles
	-Add Shell fragments when a Shell is destroyed

-Lightning Bolts should cause players to drop items

-Possible multiplayer improvements
	-vehicle collisions could be more realistic (focus on top + bottom collisions)
	-star collisions should be different to normal collisions
